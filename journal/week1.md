# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework

### Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)
 
To probe that I did this, I am explaining the problem I had to solve.
Had to replace the gitpod environment variables with github environment variables.
By running `env | grep 3000` and `env | grep <mydomainname>` I was able to identify which variables I had to use.
